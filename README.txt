In this assignment, we had to add to the code that we made last week. The code now includes three additional functions. 
1. The first function is the create_file function which creates a dsu file with a filename inputted by the user. 
2. The second function is the delete_file function which deletes a file only if it has the dsu extension on it which means that a file such as student .dsu will be deleted from the specified file directory. 
3. The third function is the read_file function which reads the contents of a specific file given that the user has entered a valid file directory. If the file is empty it will print the statement "EMPTY". If the file contains text then the text will be printed out onto the shell. 
4. These are the additional functions including the ones from last week which worked more with files and directories rather than working with a singular file.
